# COSSIM-HPC
Extension of COSSIM simulation framework which can simulate complete heterogeneous HPC Systems supporting ARM and RISC-V CPUs.

## The contribution of this work can be summarized in the following points:
 - The integration of PCI Host to RISC-V GEM5 board and adaptation of GEM5 ethernet card to it in order to simulate multi-node RISC-V systems in COSSIM simulator (we merge the development code in the official GEM5 repository).
 - An innovative flow to enable the designers to simulate the complete aspects of HPC Systems (i.e. CPU and Network Environment) through real MPI applications within one simulation framework creating HPC runtime environment inside simulation framework.
